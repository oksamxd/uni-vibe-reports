I created this project using LLM like chatGPT and lovable AI . 
the questions i asked to the LLM were :

My Understanding : I realised that event management between schools is a simpler task if streamlined properly and put into proper phases . 
What’s Inside
- Built with **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Includes pages/components for:
  - **Event listings** (view and register)
  - **Attendance check-ins**
  - **Feedback submission**
  - **Reports dashboard** (popularity, participation, feedback scores, etc.)
- Clean project setup—everything you need to just `npm i && npm run dev`

## Why I Built It

Inspired by a real assignment prompt, I wanted to explore:
- How to showcase core functionalities like registration, attendance, reports in a lean frontend
- Clean folder structure using `src/` and clear separation of UI components
- Simplicity without an actual backend—mocking features to get UI working end-to-end

## How It Runs

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oksamxd/uni-vibe-reports.git


   Uni-Vibe Reports is a simple frontend project I built to manage campus events. It lets students browse events, register, mark attendance, and give feedback, while also showing basic reports like event popularity and participation. I focused on keeping the UI clean and functional using TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind, with mock data to simulate backend features. The goal was to cover the assignment requirements in a straightforward way and show how I think about both design and usability.
